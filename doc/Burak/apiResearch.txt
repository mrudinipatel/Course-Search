Issues with their API:
    - Not all fields are there
    - CORS error

How we plan to use it:
    - Get all courses and populate the selection field
    - Get all subjects and populate the dropdown filter
    - Once the user submits, first call prereq endpoint without params to get their courses without prereqs.
    - Then call prereq endpoint with selected courses.
    - Save all of these courses in an array.
    - Apply the filters to that array.
    - Populate results.
    - Depending on how they update the api, call getCourseByCode endpoint whenever user clicks on a result course to show all fields (description, credits, offering etc.)
    - Reset cleans all results/selected courses/filters.
