**Summary of Findings:**
- Tree graphs are a type of data visualization used to represent hierarchical structures in a tree-like format

- Each node can represent a course and contain the course ID labeled on it

- **D3.js (Data-Driven Documents):** A JS library that allows one to create dynamic visual representations of data using HTML, CSS, and SVG. Supports tree graphs and also zooming and dragging.

- **Apache ECharts:** A js library that supports tree graphs and is designed for use in web browsers.

- **Sigma.js:** A js library that is good for rendering larger graphs – this one looked nice but doesn’t seem like a great fit since it can be hard to follow with multiple labels

**This GitHub repo has a great example of a tree with D3.js:** https://gist.github.com/d3noob/8375092
