# Retrospecitve ideas on the sprints

## Sprint 1: Extract data

### Summary

- Scrapped the data for accuracy
- Collected all data, used special characters as seperators as the data contains commas

### Improvements to implement

- Most of the feedback/future improvements were sprint method related, not code
- Data scrapped is pretty robust and has been used and modified in later sprints

## Sprint 2: VBA Course Search

### Summary

- Generate possible future courses (in VBA)

### Improvements to implement

- File naming conventions - using past sprints as a reference
  - File names: `camelCasing`
  - Variable names: `use_underscores`
  - Class names: `MightBeCamelCasing`
- Excel file version control - not applicable to this sprint

## Sprint 4: PHP API

### Summary

- First created the API

### Improvements to implement

- They were done in Sprint 5
- For sprint 9, maybe we can improve available.php to be more accurate

## Sprint 5: Improving API

### Summary

- Improved API from Sprint 4

### Improvements to implement

- Most of future improvements were sprint related, not applicable to our site
- Created authentication for create, delete, and update course - assuming we don't want to utilize these calls?

## Sprint 6: Utilize Another Group's API

### Summary

- Implement a course search page using another group's API.

### Improvements to implement

- Only recommendation from this sprint was to start preliminary testing earlier to resolve issues earlier on in the week by communicating with the other team.
- Add more fields to the courses in the 'results' list (which we did in subsequent sprints).

## Sprint 8: Graph the prerequisites

### Summary

- Created the graph representing all of the courses that lead up to a course  

### Improvements to implement

- Fix the "OR" that leads to courses like CIS*1200
- Color the graph so that it is less confusing
- Implement a hierarchy so that the graph is less confusing
- Show the prerequisites, not the parsed prerequisites
- Make the graphs more accessible
