# Jen's Notes

## Sprint 9

We had a roadmap idea, where a user could input a major and we would generate a tree with a roadmap. Given the complexity of a major's requirements and the many differences from our "prerequisite tree" that we have implemented, we decided to pivot away from it after Olivia and Rashi's initial analysis.  

Work left to do this week:

- team lead tasks
  - performing daily standup
  - demo/retro - sunday 4pm
- updating my personal about page
  - maybe review it after "dark mode" is implemented
- misc. documentation
  - readme updates
  - personal notes
  - retrospective slides
