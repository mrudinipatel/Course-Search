        <p>
            The course catalog is a search tool different then ours. Our functionality focuses on showing
            courses the user is eligible for based off of the prerequisites. The course catalog is
            just a tool to search all courses through different search types, including keyword, subjects,
            semesters, location, and academic level. If you are curious about general courses, the Course Catalog
            would be helpful. If you want to learn what courses you are eligible for, our Course Search tool included
            on this site would be reccomended.
